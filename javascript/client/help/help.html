    <p style="display: block;">In the chat windows you can specify you are expressing a command by putting a '#' in front of what you write.
      <br>every valid expression is build like so:
      <br>  '#<i>Verb</i> <i>Noun</i> <i>a</i>', while
      <br>      <i>Verb</i> is replaced by <b>Set</b> or <b>Get</b> and
      <br>      <i>Noun</i> is replaced by <b>Round</b> and
      <br>      <i>a</i>    is replaced by a natural number smaller than the maximum amount of playable rounds by the given amount of players and bigger than zero
      <br>for example '#Set Rounds' with <i>Verb</i> = 'Set' and <i>Noun</i> = 'Rounds'
      <br>  causes the round after which the game ends to be set to the number you enter seperated by a space after '#Set Rounds'
      <br>so for example '#Set Rounds 6' sets the game to end after the sixth round.
      <br>
      <br>possible verbs = { Set, Get }
      <br>possible nouns = { Rounds }
